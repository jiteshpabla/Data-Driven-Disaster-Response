## About:
Visualization tools augment human analysis and provide new insights. The yearly Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenges test researchers' ability to transform data into consumable information for assisting humans in fictional but realistic scenarios. The VAST 2019 Mini-Challenge 3 asks participants to determine problems an earthquake causes for a city. In the 2019 scenario, the city is experiencing seismic activity and needs advice on distributing resources. Through applying data visualization techniques learned throughout CSE575, our team delivers an interactive tool for city officials and citizens to understand how the city is affected by quakes.
